<h3>Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands</h3>
<br/><br/>
Majuro Atoll is a chain of small islands in the American-owned Marshall Islands.  It's the one at left, here:

<br/><br/>
The island chain is 30 miles long from tip to tip, but at any point the island is only a few city blocks wide, or thinner.

<br/><br/>
The island has one main road which acts as sort of a backbone, going around the islands from Laura (northwest) to Rita (northeast).  You can see it in that picture, just barely fitting past the airport.
<br/><br/>
Anyhow, I had a crazy idea to straighten out the road into one long line, and distort the land to fit that outline using OpenStreetMap data, JavaScript, and HTML5 Canvas. And here you go.
