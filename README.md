# Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands

Majuro Atoll is a chain of small islands in the American-owned Marshall Islands.  It's the one at left, here:

The island chain is around 30 miles long, but at any point the island is only a city block wide, or even thinner.

The island has one main road which acts as sort of a backbone, going around the islands from Laura (northwest) to Rita (northeast).  You can see it in that picture, just barely fitting past the airport.

Anyhow, I had a crazy idea to straighten out the road into one long line, and distort the land to fit that outline using OpenStreetMap data, JavaScript, and HTML5 Canvas. And here you go.
